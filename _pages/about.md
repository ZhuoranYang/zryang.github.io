I am an Assistant Professor of [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) at Yale University. I am also affiliated with the [Yale Institute for Foundations of Data Science](https://fds.yale.edu/) and [Center for Algorithms, Data, and Market Design at Yale (CADMY)](https://cadmy.yale.edu/).


My research interests span the intersection of machine learning, statistics, game theory, and optimization. 
In particular, I mainly work on the following topics recently: 

-- **Foundation of Reinforcement Learning**, especially in the context of multi-agent systems where agents interact strategically;

-- **Foundation of Artificial Intelligence**, especially in understanding the emergent behaviors of large language models during pre-training and post-training and their relationship with the model architecture. 

My research is supported by NSF DMS 2413243. 

Before coming to Yale, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of [Michael. I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University, where I was co-advised by [Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/) and [Han Liu](http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html). I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics at Tsinghua University in 2015.

**Openings**

I am looking for self-motivated **Ph.D. students** and **postdocs** with a strong mathematical and/or programming background.
I am also happy to host (remote) undergraduate/graduate visitors with common research interests. 
Feel free to contact me via **email with your CV** if you are interested in working with me.
